# rocFFT Examples

## Summary
The examples in this subdirectory showcase the functionality of the [rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/) library. The examples build on Linux for ROCm (AMD GPU).

## Prerequisites
### Linux
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (at least version 3.21)
- OR GNU Make - available via the distribution's package manager
- [ROCm](https://docs.amd.com/bundle/ROCm-Installation-Guide-v5.1.3/page/Overview_of_ROCm_Installation_Methods.html) (at least version 5.x.x)
- [rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/)
    - `rocfft` package available from [repo.radeon.com](https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/). The repository is added during the standard ROCm [install procedure](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/).

### Windows
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019 or 2022 with the "Desktop Development with C++" workload
- ROCm toolchain for Windows (No public release yet)
    - The Visual Studio ROCm extension needs to be installed to build with the solution files.
- [rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/)
    - Installed as part of the ROCm SDK on Windows for ROCm platform.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (optional, to build with CMake. Requires at least version 3.21)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (optional, to build with CMake)

## Building
### Linux
Make sure that the dependencies are installed, or use one of the [provided Dockerfiles](../../Dockerfiles/) to build and run the examples in a containerized environment.

#### Using CMake
All examples in the `rocFFT` subdirectory can either be built by a single CMake project or be built independently.

- `$ cd Libraries/rocFFT`
- `$ cmake -S . -B build`
- `$ cmake --build build`

#### Using Make
All examples can be built by a single invocation to Make or be built independently.

- `$ cd Libraries/rocFFT`
- `$ make`

### Windows
#### Visual Studio
Visual Studio solution files are available for the individual examples. To build all examples for rocFFT open the top level solution file [ROCm-Examples-VS2019.sln](../../ROCm-Examples-VS2019.sln) and filter for rocFFT.

For more detailed build instructions refer to the top level [README.md](../../README.md#visual-studio).

#### CMake
All examples in the `rocFFT` subdirectory can either be built by a single CMake project or be built independently. For build instructions refer to the top-level [README.md](../../README.md#cmake-2).
