## Prerequisites
### Linux
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (at least version 3.21)
- A number of examples also support building via  GNU Make - available through the distribution's package manager
- [ROCm](https://docs.amd.com/bundle/ROCm-Installation-Guide-v5.1.3/page/Overview_of_ROCm_Installation_Methods.html) (at least version 5.x.x)
- For example-specific prerequisites, see the example subdirectories.

### Windows
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019 or 2022 with the "Desktop Development with C++" workload
- ROCm toolchain for Windows (No public release yet)
  - The Visual Studio ROCm extension needs to be installed to build with the solution files.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (optional, to build with CMake. Requires at least version 3.21)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (optional, to build with CMake)

## Building the example suite
### Linux
These instructions assume that the prerequisites for every example are installed on the system.

#### CMake
See [CMake build options](#cmake-build-options) for an overview of build options.
- `$ git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git`
- `$ cd rocm-examples`
- `$ cmake -S . -B build` (on ROCm) or `$ cmake -S . -B build -D GPU_RUNTIME=CUDA` (on CUDA)
- `$ cmake --build build`
- `$ cmake --install build --prefix install`

#### Make
Beware that only a subset of the examples support building via Make.
- `$ git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git`
- `$ cd rocm-examples`
- `$ make` (on ROCm) or `$ make GPU_RUNTIME=CUDA` (on CUDA)

### Linux with Docker
Alternatively, instead of installing the prerequisites on the system, the [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples/tree/develop/Dockerfiles/) in this repository can be used to build images that provide all required prerequisites. Note, that the ROCm kernel GPU driver still needs to be installed on the host system.

The following instructions showcase building the Docker image and full example suite inside the container using CMake:
- `$ git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git`
- `$ cd rocm-examples/Dockerfiles`
- `$ docker build . -t rocm-examples -f hip-libraries-rocm-ubuntu.Dockerfile` (on ROCm) or `$ docker build . -t rocm-examples -f hip-libraries-cuda-ubuntu.Dockerfile` (on CUDA)
- `$ docker run -it --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri rocm-examples bash` (on ROCm) or `$ docker run -it --gpus=all rocm-examples bash` (on CUDA)
- `# git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git`
- `# cd rocm-examples`
- `# cmake -S . -B build` (on ROCm) or `$ cmake -S . -B build -D GPU_RUNTIME=CUDA` (on CUDA)
- `# cmake --build build`

The built executables can be found and run in the `build` directory:
- `# ./build/Libraries/rocRAND/simple_distributions_cpp/simple_distributions_cpp`

### Windows
#### Visual Studio
The repository has Visual Studio project files for all examples and individually for each example.
- Project files for Visual Studio are named as the example with `_vs<Visual Studio Version>` suffix added e.g. `device_sum_vs2019.sln` for the device sum example.
- The project files can be built from Visual Studio or from the command line using MSBuild.
  - Use the build solution command in Visual Studio to build.
  - To build from the command line execute `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<Visual Studio Version>\<Edition>\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe <path to project folder>`.
    - To build in Release mode pass the `/p:Configuration=Release` option to MSBuild.
    - The executables will be created in a subfolder named "Debug" or "Release" inside the project folder.
- The HIP specific project settings like the GPU architectures targeted can be set on the `General [AMD HIP C++]` tab of project properties.
- The top level solution files come in two flavors: `ROCm-Examples-VS<Visual Studio Verson>.sln` and `ROCm-Examples-Portable-VS<Visual Studio Version>.sln`. The former contains all examples, while the latter contains the examples that support both ROCm and CUDA.

#### CMake
First, clone the repository and go to the source directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git
cd rocm-examples
```

There are two ways to build the project using CMake: with the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt (recommended) or with a standard Command Prompt. See [CMake build options](#cmake-build-options) for an overview of build options.

##### Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
Select Start, search for "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019", and the resulting Command Prompt. Ninja must be selected as generator, and Clang as C++ compiler.

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang
cmake --build build
```

##### Standard Command Prompt
Run the standard Command Prompt. When using the standard Command Prompt to build the project, the Resource Compiler (RC) path must be specified. The RC is a tool used to build Windows-based applications, its default path is `C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/bin/<Windows version>/x64/rc.exe`. Finally, the generator must be set to Ninja.

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_RC_COMPILER="<path to rc compiler>"
cmake --build build
```

### CMake build options
The following options are available when building with CMake.
